# WORK IN PROGRESS

## Welcome to my brand new website! I am still working on the content that will go here. Soon, you can expect to see detailed discussions of the physics research I have conducted at West Virginia University and Princeton University, as well as educational outreach I have led, and much more! Some of these projects include:
- Measuring previously unknown quantum values of iodine, which I wrote a peer-reviewed paper about at the end of my undergraduate degree (email me for a PDF)
- Leading a team of peers in analyzing cyclic space weather patterns from the polar orbit of the STF-1 CubeSat (see stf1.com)
- Creating a recurrent neural network workflow to analyze nuclear fusion data in real time
- Building the PHAse Space MApping experiment at West Virginia University to push the boundaries of basic plasma physics research
- Continuing my passion for science education from the American Physical Society conference halls to middle school classrooms in West Virginia
- Figuring out how to turn complicated processes such as spectroscopy into fun and educational video gameplay mechanics
